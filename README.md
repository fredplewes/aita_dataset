# AITA Dataset
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/240335515.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/240335515)

_Great news! Since the original blog post was shared, we discovered that the API used to collect post scores excluded ~30K posts from AITA in 2018-2019. These have been added to the dataset in the latest release. We will be sharing an update to some of the metrics calculated in the blog shortly._

This repo contains code to replicate our scrape of the r/AmItheAsshole subreddit, as well as .dvc files linking this GitHub repo to an S3 bucket hosting the dataset. 

Building the dataset is accomplished in three scripts:
1. `0_scraper_push_api.py` collects Reddit post ids and scores from within a desired timeframe.
2. `1_scraper_praw.py` uses the praw library to query each post by id, and grab associated text and meta-data.
3. `2_clean_and_consolidate.py` cleans data and does some general neatening. 

The dataset contained in `aita_clean.csv` has 9 features:

- id, a unique string provided by Reddit's API to index every post
- timestamp of post creation, in epoch/Unix format
- title, a string 
- body, a string 
- edited, the timestamp at which a post was edited. If no edits occurred this field is False.
- verdict, a string in the set {"asshole", "not the asshole", "everyone sucks", "no assholes here") 
- score, an integer corresponding to the difference between upvotes and downvotes
- num_comments, an integer corresponding to the total number of comments (including nested discussion) to the post
- is_asshole, a boolean corresponding to whether the verdict is in the set {"asshole","everyone sucks"}

To get this dataset, install DVC and run:

`$ dvc get https://github.com/fredplewes/aita_dataset aita_clean.csv`

or

`$ dvc import https://github.com/fredplewes/aita_dataset aita_clean.csv` to also download the associated .dvc files for data set versioning.
